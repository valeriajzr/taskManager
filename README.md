# C++ Calendar Task Scheduler

This project implements a **calendar-based task scheduler** in C++ using **dynamic memory** and **linked lists**. Each day of each month can store a list of tasks, allowing users to:

- Select a date (month/day)
- Add, view, and remove tasks in a linked list
- Initialize a default list of tasks
- Manage daily tasks interactively through a console menu

## Core Concepts

- Pointer manipulation
- Triple pointer matrix to simulate a 2D calendar structure with dynamic task lists
- Manual memory management
- Linked list operations (insert, delete, traverse)
- Basic menu-driven UI

For practicing low-level data structure manipulation, dynamic allocation, and user interaction in C++.
